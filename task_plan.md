# Task Plan: Deep Research on Agentic Virtual Tumor Boards

## Goal
Compile comprehensive academic bibliography for a scientific paper on multi-agent AI systems for oncology decision support, focusing on democratizing precision oncology access.

## Thesis
Multi-agent AI systems with adversarial deliberation, verified data extraction, and multimodal grounding can democratize access to precision oncology for resource-constrained settings (particularly India where 77% of patients lack access to tumor boards).

## Phases
- [x] Phase 1: Research Multi-Agent Medical AI Systems (MARC-v1, MAI-DxO, MedAgents, AgentClinic)
- [x] Phase 2: Research Medical AI Safety & Hallucination Prevention
- [x] Phase 3: Research Multimodal Medical AI (MedGemma, radiology, pathology)
- [x] Phase 4: Research Tumor Boards & Clinical Decision Support
- [x] Phase 5: Research Global Health & Healthcare Access (India focus)
- [x] Phase 6: Research Technical Approaches (RAG, CoT, HITL)
- [x] Phase 7: Compile and format final bibliography

## Key Questions
1. What are the latest multi-agent architectures for medical AI?
2. How do adversarial debate frameworks improve diagnostic accuracy?
3. What evidence exists for AI improving healthcare equity?
4. What are current approaches to hallucination prevention in medical LLMs?

## Decisions Made
- Focus on 2022-2026 papers with emphasis on most recent
- Include both seminal and cutting-edge work
- Format for LaTeX academic paper
