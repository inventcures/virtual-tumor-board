## Surgical Oncology Assessment: Anita Menon, 55yo Female, Stage IIIC HGSOC

**Patient:** Anita Menon, 55yo Female
**Diagnosis:** Ovarian High Grade Serous Carcinoma, Stage IIIC (T3cN1M0)
**Key Features:** BRCA1 germline mutation, HRD positive, ECOG 1, controlled Hypothyroidism.

As Dr. Shalya, a Surgical Oncology specialist, I have carefully reviewed the case of Ms. Anita Menon. My assessment focuses on achieving the best possible oncologic and functional outcomes, considering the unique biological profile of her tumor and the Indian healthcare context.

### 1. Resectability Assessment

Ms. Menon presents with Stage IIIC HGSOC, characterized by bilateral ovarian involvement, peritoneal implants greater than 2 cm beyond the pelvis (T3c), and regional lymph node involvement (N1). While specific imaging details (e.g., CT abdomen/pelvis, PET-CT findings, presence of ascites) are not provided, the T3c descriptor inherently suggests widespread peritoneal disease.

*   **Anatomical Considerations:**
    *   **Primary Disease:** Bilateral ovarian masses are generally resectable.
    *   **Peritoneal Carcinomatosis (T3c):** This is the most critical aspect. Implants >2 cm can be present on the omentum (infracolic and supracolic), diaphragmatic surfaces (right hemidiaphragm often involved), bowel serosa (small and large intestine), mesentery, paracolic gutters, liver capsule, and splenic capsule. Involvement of the rectosigmoid colon is common.
    *   **Lymph Node Involvement (N1):** This typically refers to pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodes. While potentially resectable, extensive or bulky nodal disease can complicate PDS.
    *   **Vascular/Organ Involvement Concerns:** Although not explicitly stated, T3c disease carries a risk of involvement of critical structures. This includes:
        *   **Bowel:** Extensive small bowel serosal implants, mesenteric involvement, or transmural invasion requiring multiple bowel resections and anastomoses.
        *   **Urinary Tract:** Ureteral involvement (intrinsic or extrinsic compression) requiring ureterolysis or resection/re-implantation. Bladder serosal involvement.
        *   **Upper Abdomen:** Significant diaphragmatic involvement requiring stripping or partial resection. Liver capsule implants (requiring superficial stripping). Splenic involvement (requiring splenectomy). Pancreatic or gastric serosal involvement (less common in T3c but possible).
        *   **Major Vessels:** Close proximity or encasement of superior mesenteric artery/vein, aorta, vena cava, or iliac vessels could compromise R0 resection or increase surgical morbidity.

*   **Technical Feasibility of R0 Resection:** The primary goal of surgical cytoreduction in advanced ovarian cancer is to achieve **R0 resection (no macroscopic residual disease)**, as this is the strongest prognostic factor for survival. For Stage IIIC disease, achieving R0 upfront can be challenging due to the extent of peritoneal spread. The presence of BRCA1 germline mutation, however, suggests high chemosensitivity, which is a favorable factor if neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is considered. Without detailed imaging to assess the Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Index (PCI) and the likelihood of achieving R0, a definitive statement on upfront R0 feasibility is difficult. However, the T3c description suggests a high likelihood of multi-visceral resections being necessary if PDS is attempted.

### 2. Patient Operability

*   **Performance Status:** Ms. Menon has an ECOG performance status of 1. This indicates that she is fully ambulatory and able to carry out light work or sedentary activities, limiting only physically strenuous activity. An ECOG 1 is generally considered an excellent performance status for undergoing major abdominal surgery, suggesting good functional reserve.
*   **Comorbidity Impact:** Her only stated comorbidity is controlled hypothyroidism. If her thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are within the normal range, this condition poses minimal to no additional surgical risk. It is crucial to ensure optimal thyroid function pre-operatively.
*   **Pre-operative Optimization Recommendations:**
    1.  **Thyroid Function Test (TFT):** Reconfirm TSH and free T4 levels are within the euthyroid range. Adjust levothyroxine dosage if necessary.
    2.  **Nutritional Assessment:** Assess for any nutritional deficiencies, especially given the elevated CA-125 which might correlate with symptom burden. Optimize nutrition if needed (oral supplements, or rarely, parenteral support).
    3.  **Cardiac Clearance:** Given her age and major surgery planned, a comprehensive cardiac evaluation (ECG, echo if indicated) is prudent to rule out occult cardiac issues, even with ECOG 1.
    4.  **Respiratory Assessment:** Basic pulmonary function tests might be considered, especially if there's any history of smoking or respiratory symptoms.
    5.  **Hematological Optimization:** Ensure hemoglobin levels are optimal. Consider iron supplementation if anemic.
    6.  **DVT Prophylaxis:** Plan for mechanical and pharmacological deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis given the high risk associated with major pelvic-abdominal surgery for malignancy.
    7.  **Psychological Support:** Address patient anxiety and provide clear communication regarding the treatment plan.

### 3. Surgical Approach Recommendation

Considering the Stage IIIC (T3cN1M0) disease, the high CA-125 (1,250 U/mL), and the presence of a BRCA1 germline mutation (indicating chemosensitivity), the choice between Primary Debulking Surgery (PDS) and Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT) followed by Interval Debulking Surgery (IDS) is critical.

*   **Recommendation: Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy followed by Interval Debulking Surgery (NACT-IDS).**
    *   **Rationale:** While Ms. Menon has an excellent ECOG status, the T3c disease (peritoneal implants >2 cm) suggests a high tumor burden where achieving R0 upfront via PDS might necessitate extensive multi-visceral resections, potentially leading to increased morbidity without guaranteed R0. The NCCN Guidelines (Version 1.2024, Ovarian Cancer) state that NACT followed by IDS is an appropriate option for patients with a high tumor burden where complete gross resection is unlikely or for patients who are not optimal candidates for PDS. The BRCA1 mutation strongly suggests that her tumor will be highly sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy, making NACT an effective strategy to reduce tumor burden, shrink implants, and potentially convert a complex R0 PDS into a more manageable R0 IDS. This approach can also reduce operative time and post-operative complications.
    *   **Open vs. Minimally Invasive:** For advanced Stage IIIC HGSOC requiring comprehensive cytoreduction, the surgical approach for debulking (whether PDS or IDS) is almost universally **open laparotomy**. Minimally invasive approaches (laparoscopy or robotics) are generally not suitable for achieving R0 in such extensive disease, except perhaps for diagnostic staging biopsies or very limited early-stage disease.
    *   **Extent of Resection (for IDS):** The goal of IDS will be complete gross resection (R0). This will involve:
        *   Total Abdominal Hysterectomy (TAH)
        *   Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy (BSO)
        *   Infracolic Omentectomy (and supracolic if involved)
        *   Complete peritoneal debulking, including stripping of the diaphragm, excision of any residual peritoneal implants from bowel serosa, mesentery, paracolic gutters, and pelvic sidewalls.
        *   Resection of any involved bowel segments (e.g., rectosigmoidectomy with primary anastomosis) or other organs (e.g., splenectomy, partial bladder resection) if residual disease persists after NACT.
        *   Pelvic and Para-aortic Lymphadenectomy: To address the N1 disease, and to complete staging if not fully performed initially.
    *   **Reconstruction Needs:** Anticipate potential bowel anastomoses. Ureteral re-implantation might be necessary if ureters are involved.

### 4. Timing & Sequencing

*   **Decision: Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT) followed by Interval Debulking Surgery (IDS).**
    *   **Rationale:** As discussed, NACT offers the advantage of downstaging the disease, particularly beneficial in a BRCA1-mutated, chemosensitive tumor. This improves the likelihood of achieving R0 at IDS and potentially reduces surgical morbidity.
    *   **NACT Regimen:** Typically 3 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy (e.g., Carboplatin and Paclitaxel).
    *   **Criteria for Reassessment:** After 3 cycles of NACT, Ms. Menon will undergo re-evaluation. This includes:
        *   **Clinical Assessment:** Performance status, symptom resolution, physical examination.
        *   **Tumor Markers:** Repeat CA-125 and HE4 levels. A significant drop (e.g., >50% or normalization of CA-125) indicates good response.
        *   **Imaging:** Repeat contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis (and chest if indicated) to assess tumor response and re-evaluate resectability. The goal is to see significant reduction in tumor size and peritoneal implants.
    *   **Window for Surgery:** IDS is typically performed after 3-4 cycles of NACT, once optimal tumor response is achieved. After surgery, Ms. Menon will complete the remaining 3-4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy to total 6 cycles. The entire process aims to deliver systemic therapy effectively while allowing for optimal surgical intervention.

**Medical Oncology Assessment for Anita Menon**

**Patient:** Anita Menon, 55-year-old Female
**Diagnosis:** Stage IIIC (T3cN1M0) High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma (HGSOC)
**Key Features:** BRCA1 germline mutation, HRD positive (score 52), ECOG PS 1, Controlled Hypothyroidism.

**1. Biomarker Interpretation**

*   **CA-125 (1,250 U/mL) & HE4 (Elevated):** These are tumor markers useful for diagnosis, monitoring response to therapy, and detecting recurrence. The high baseline levels are consistent with advanced ovarian cancer. They are not directly actionable for targeted therapy but are crucial for disease surveillance.
*   **HRD Score: Positive (score 52):** A positive HRD score, particularly with a high value like 52, indicates a significant defect in homologous recombination repair pathways. This makes the tumor highly sensitive to PARP (Poly ADP-ribose Polymerase) inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy. This is a highly **actionable** biomarker.
*   **BRCA1 Germline 185delAG:** This is a pathogenic germline mutation in the *BRCA1* gene. This mutation directly causes the HRD phenotype and is a strong predictor of exceptional response to PARP inhibitors and platinum chemotherapy. This is a highly **actionable** biomarker, confirming the HRD status. It also has significant implications for family screening.
*   **TP53 R248Q:** This is a common somatic mutation in *TP53*, frequently found in HGSOC. While *TP53* mutations are generally associated with aggressive disease and often predict resistance to some therapies, in HGSOC, it is a defining feature rather than an independent prognostic marker for treatment selection. It is not currently **actionable** with specific targeted therapies.
*   **TMB (3 mut/Mb) & MSI (MSS):** The low Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) and Microsatellite Stable (MSS) status indicate that the patient's tumor is highly unlikely to benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. These biomarkers are **prognostic** for immunotherapy response, indicating a negative prediction in this case.

**Additional Testing Recommended:** Given the BRCA1 germline mutation, genetic counseling and germline genetic testing for first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) are strongly recommended to identify at-risk individuals for cancer surveillance or risk-reducing surgeries.

**2. Optimal Surgical Approach & Role of HIPEC**

For Stage IIIC HGSOC, both primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) are acceptable approaches.
*   **Preference:** Given the patient's good ECOG PS (1), controlled comorbidities, and the chemosensitive nature of BRCA1-mutated HGSOC, **primary debulking surgery (PDS) with the goal of optimal cytoreduction (R0/R1)** should be strongly considered if achievable by an experienced gynecologic oncologist. Optimal debulking in the primary setting is associated with improved overall survival. However, if optimal cytoreduction is deemed unlikely based on pre-operative imaging or surgical assessment, then NACT (3 cycles of Carboplatin/Paclitaxel) followed by IDS and completion of chemotherapy (3 more cycles) is a valid alternative.
*   **Role of HIPEC:** Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) in the primary setting for ovarian cancer remains controversial. Current guidelines (NCCN, ESMO) do not recommend routine use of HIPEC outside of clinical trials. The Lb-HIPEC trial showed a benefit in select patients undergoing IDS, but this was for recurrent disease or specific settings, not routinely for primary Stage IIIC. Given the lack of robust evidence for routine primary use and potential added morbidity, I would **not recommend HIPEC** in the primary setting for Anita outside of a clinical trial.

**3. Systemic Therapy Recommendation (First-line)**

The patient's BRCA1 germline mutation and HRD positivity make her an excellent candidate for platinum-based chemotherapy followed by PARP inhibitor maintenance.

*   **First-line Regimen:**
    *   **Carboplatin AUC 5-6 + Paclitaxel 175 mg/m$^2$ IV every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.**
    *   **Rationale:** This platinum-taxane doublet is the standard of care for first-line treatment of advanced HGSOC. BRCA1-mutated tumors are typically highly sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy, predicting a high response rate and improved outcomes.
    *   **Expected Efficacy:** With this regimen, particularly in BRCA-mutated patients, objective response rates (ORR) can exceed 70-80%, with high rates of complete response (CR). Median progression-free survival (PFS) in BRCA-mutated patients receiving chemotherapy alone is typically around 18-24 months, but with PARP inhibitor maintenance, this significantly extends.

**4. Treatment Sequencing & Duration**

*   **Sequencing:**
    1.  **Surgery:** PDS (if optimal debulking is feasible) or NACT (3 cycles) followed by IDS (if NACT route chosen).
    2.  **Adjuvant/Completion Chemotherapy:** Complete 6 cycles of Carboplatin + Paclitaxel.
    3.  **Maintenance Therapy:** Initiate PARP inhibitor maintenance after completion of chemotherapy and recovery from acute toxicities (typically within 8 weeks).
*   **Duration of Therapy:**
    *   Chemotherapy: 6 cycles (approximately 4.5 months).
    *   Maintenance Therapy: Olaparib maintenance for a duration of **2 years**, as demonstrated in the SOLO-1 trial.

**5. Targeted Therapy Options**

Given the BRCA1 germline mutation and HRD positivity, a PARP inhibitor is the optimal choice for maintenance therapy.

*   **Primary Recommendation: Olaparib**
    *   **Agent:** Olaparib (Lynparza®)
    *   **Dose:** 300 mg orally twice daily.
    *   **Rationale:** The **SOLO-1 trial** (NCCN Category 1, ESMO Category I, Level A) demonstrated a profound and statistically significant improvement in PFS with olaparib maintenance in newly diagnosed, advanced HGSOC patients with *BRCA1/2* mutations who had achieved a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. The median PFS for olaparib was 56 months vs. 13.8 months for placebo, with a hazard ratio of 0.30. At 7 years, 45.3% of patients on olaparib were progression-free, compared to 11.5% on placebo. This trial established olaparib as the standard of care for BRCA-mutated patients in this setting.
*   **Alternative/Combination Consideration (and rationale for not primary recommendation here):**
    *   **Olaparib + Bevacizumab:** The **PAOLA-1 trial** (NCCN Category 1, ESMO Category I, Level A) showed that adding olaparib to bevacizumab maintenance improved PFS in patients with newly diagnosed advanced HGSOC who are HRD positive, irrespective of BRCA mutation status. While this combination is a valid option for HRD+ patients, for patients with *germline BRCA1/2 mutations*, the magnitude of benefit with olaparib monotherapy (SOLO-1) is extremely high, and the incremental benefit of adding bevacizumab to olaparib in this specific subgroup is less pronounced and adds to toxicity and cost. Therefore, for this patient with a strong BRCA1 germline mutation, **olaparib monotherapy is prioritized** due to its robust efficacy and potentially better tolerability profile compared to the combination.
    *   **Niraparib:** The **PRIMA trial** (NCCN Category 1, ESMO Category I, Level A) demonstrated that niraparib maintenance improved PFS in newly diagnosed advanced HGSOC patients who are HRD positive, regardless of BRCA mutation status. While niraparib is another excellent PARP inhibitor option, olaparib has the most extensive long-term follow-up data specifically in *BRCA-mutated* patients (SOLO-1).

**6. Toxicity Management**

*   **Carboplatin/Paclitaxel:**
    *   **Expected Side Effects:** Myelosuppression (neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia), peripheral neuropathy (cumulative with paclitaxel), alopecia, nausea/vomiting, fatigue, hypersensitivity reactions (especially to paclitaxel).
    *   **Monitoring:** Weekly CBC during chemotherapy, renal and liver function tests before each cycle, neurologic assessment for neuropathy.
    *   **Dose Modification:** Based on nadir counts (ANC <1000, platelets <75,000) or grade 2/3 non-hematologic toxicities (e.g., neuropathy). Growth factor support (G-CSF) for neutropenia.
*   **Olaparib Maintenance:**
    *   **Expected Side Effects:** Anemia (most common, often managed with dose reduction or transfusions), nausea, fatigue, vomiting, myelosuppression.
    *   **Monitoring:** Baseline CBC, then monthly for the first year, and periodically thereafter.
    *   **Dose Modification:** Based on severity of side effects, particularly hematologic toxicities. Standard dose reduction steps (300mg BID to 250mg BID, then 200mg BID) are available.

**7. Response Assessment Plan**

*   **During NACT (if applicable):** Clinical assessment, CA-125 measurement after 3 cycles, and potentially CT scan (chest, abdomen, pelvis) before IDS.
*   **After Chemotherapy Completion:**
    *   **Timing:** Within 4-8 weeks after completing the final chemotherapy cycle.
    *   **Modality:** CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. CA-125 measurement.
    *   **Criteria:** Response will be assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria for radiographic response and GCIG criteria for CA-125 response.
*   **During Maintenance Therapy:**
    *   **Timing:** Every 3-4 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months or as clinically indicated.
    *   **Modality:** CA-125 measurement. CT scan (chest, abdomen, pelvis) should be performed if CA-125 rises significantly or if there are new symptoms suggestive of recurrence.
    *   **Criteria:** Continue olaparib if there is no evidence of disease progression. Discontinue upon confirmed radiographic progression or intolerable toxicity.

**8. Indian Healthcare Context**

*   **Drug Availability:**
    *   **Carboplatin and Paclitaxel:** Widely available in India, including generic formulations from various manufacturers.
    *   **Olaparib (Lynparza®):** Available in India as a branded drug (AstraZeneca).

## Radiation Oncology Assessment for Anita Menon

**Patient:** Anita Menon, 55yo Female
**Diagnosis:** Stage IIIC High Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma (HGSOC), BRCA1 germline mutation, HRD positive.

As Dr. Kirann, a senior Radiation Oncologist, I have reviewed the case of Ms. Anita Menon. My assessment focuses on the role of radiation therapy in her current presentation and potential future scenarios, considering the Indian healthcare context.

---

### 1. RT Indication Assessment

**Is radiation indicated for this case? Why/why not?**
For Ms. Anita Menon's primary diagnosis of Stage IIIC High Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma, **radiation therapy is generally NOT indicated as a primary or adjuvant treatment modality.**

The cornerstone of treatment for advanced ovarian cancer, including Stage IIIC HGSOC, is primary debulking surgery (PDS) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS), combined with platinum-based systemic chemotherapy. Ovarian cancer typically spreads widely within the peritoneal cavity, and microscopic disease is often diffuse. Radiation therapy is effective for localized disease control but is limited by the large treatment volumes required to cover the entire peritoneal cavity, leading to unacceptable toxicity to surrounding normal tissues such as the small bowel, large bowel, kidneys, and liver.

**Definitive vs Adjuvant vs Palliative Intent:**
*   **Definitive Intent:** Not indicated for primary advanced HGSOC due to the reasons stated above.
*   **Adjuvant Intent:** Not indicated after surgery and chemotherapy for primary disease. Systemic therapy (chemotherapy, targeted agents) provides superior control of microscopic disease.
*   **Palliative Intent:** Radiation therapy's primary role in ovarian cancer is palliative, for symptom management of localized symptomatic recurrences or metastases. This could include:
    *   Painful bone metastases
    *   Brain metastases
    *   Localized, symptomatic pelvic or abdominal recurrences that are not amenable to further surgery or systemic therapy, particularly if they are causing obstruction or bleeding.

**Expected Benefit of RT in this setting:**
In the primary setting, the expected benefit of radiation therapy is minimal to non-existent, and it would expose the patient to significant acute and late toxicities without improving progression-free or overall survival compared to standard systemic therapy. For future palliative indications, the benefit would be symptom relief and local disease control, significantly improving quality of life.

### 2. Treatment Technique (For Hypothetical Future Indications)

If a future indication for palliative radiation therapy arises, the recommended technique would depend on the site and extent of disease:

*   **Localized Pelvic/Abdominal Recurrence (if amenable to RT):** **Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) or Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT)** would be the preferred techniques.
    *   **Rationale:** These advanced techniques allow for highly conformal dose delivery, shaping the radiation dose precisely to the target while sparing critical organs at risk (OARs) such as the small bowel, rectum, bladder, and kidneys. This is crucial in previously treated patients or when treating within the abdomen/pelvis.
*   **Bone Metastases:**
    *   **3D-Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D-CRT):** For larger, less critical areas, or when rapid palliation is needed.
    *   **Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT):** For smaller, oligometastatic lesions, particularly in the spine or other anatomically challenging sites, offering higher doses per fraction with fewer treatments and excellent local control.
*   **Brain Metastases:**
    *   **Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS):** For 1-3 (or sometimes more, depending on institutional preference and patient factors) brain metastases, offering excellent local control with minimal neurocognitive impact.
    *   **Whole Brain Radiation Therapy (WBRT):** For multiple (>3-4) or diffuse brain metastases, or when SRS is not feasible.

**Image Guidance Requirements (IGRT, CBCT):**
**Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT)** is paramount for all these techniques.
*   **Cone-Beam CT (CBCT):** Daily CBCT is essential for accurate patient setup and verification of target position, especially in the abdomen/pelvis where organ motion can be significant, or for SBRT/SRS where precision is critical.
*   **Fiducial markers:** May be considered for specific abdominal targets to track tumor motion.

### 3. Dose Prescription (For Hypothetical Future Indications)

Dose prescriptions would be tailored to the specific palliative indication:

*   **Localized Pelvic/Abdominal Recurrence:**
    *   **Total Dose:** Typically 45-50.4 Gy
    *   **Fractionation Scheme:** 1.8-2 Gy per fraction
    *   **Treatment Duration:** 5-5.5 weeks
    *   **Boost:** If a residual gross tumor is present and OAR constraints allow, an additional boost of 5.4-10 Gy (totaling 54-60 Gy) might be considered.
*   **Palliative Bone Metastases:**
    *   **Single Fraction:** 8 Gy x 1 (for rapid pain relief)
    *   **Hypofractionated:** 20 Gy in 5 fractions, 30 Gy in 10 fractions (common for more durable pain control and local control).
    *   **SBRT:** 16-24 Gy in 1-3 fractions for spinal metastases, 24-30 Gy in 3-5 fractions for other sites, depending on OARs.
*   **Brain Metastases:**
    *   **SRS:** 15-24 Gy in a single fraction, or 20-30 Gy in 3-5 fractions, depending on lesion size and location.
    *   **WBRT:** 30 Gy in 10 fractions, or 20 Gy in 5 fractions.

### 4. Target Volumes (For Hypothetical Future Indications)

*   **GTV (Gross Tumor Volume):** Clearly identifiable tumor on diagnostic imaging (CT, MRI, PET-CT).
*   **CTV (Clinical Target Volume):** GTV plus a margin for microscopic disease extension. This margin varies based on tumor type, location, and natural history. For a localized recurrence, it might be 0.5-1 cm around the GTV.
*   **PTV (Planning Target Volume):** CTV plus a margin for setup uncertainties and internal organ motion. Typically 0.5-1 cm, depending on the accuracy of IGRT and motion management strategies.
*   **Elective Nodal Coverage Decisions:** Not typically indicated for palliative ovarian cancer RT unless there is specific evidence of microscopic nodal involvement or a very defined nodal recurrence. The goal is symptom control of macroscopic disease.
*   **Margins and their Rationale:** Margins are critical to ensure adequate dose delivery to the target while minimizing irradiation of healthy tissues. The specific margins are determined by imaging quality, motion management techniques (e.g., respiratory gating for abdominal targets), and daily IGRT.

### 5. Organs at Risk (For Hypothetical Future Indications)

For pelvic/abdominal irradiation, critical OARs include:

*   **Small Bowel:** High sensitivity to radiation. Dose constraints typically aim for V40Gy < 200 cc, Dmax < 50 Gy.
*   **Rectum:** V40Gy < 50%, V50Gy < 25%, Dmax < 60 Gy.
*   **Bladder:** V40Gy < 50%, V50Gy < 25%, Dmax < 60 Gy.
*   **Femoral Heads:** Dmax < 50 Gy to prevent avascular necrosis.
*   **Kidneys:** Mean dose < 18-20 Gy to prevent renal insufficiency.
*   **Bone Marrow:** Pelvic bone marrow sparing is important to reduce hematologic toxicity, especially if concurrent chemotherapy is given.

**Expected Acute and Late Toxicities:**

*   **Acute (during/shortly after treatment):** Fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, proctitis, cystitis, skin irritation within the treatment field.
*   **Late (months to years after treatment):** Chronic diarrhea, bowel stricture or obstruction, chronic proctitis/cystitis, fistulae, secondary malignancies (rare), chronic pain, lymphedema.

### 6. Timing & Sequencing (For Hypothetical Future Indications)

*   **Optimal Timing relative to surgery/chemotherapy:** For palliative RT, timing is usually dictated by symptoms and the patient's overall treatment plan. It can be given after completion of chemotherapy, or sometimes concurrently with certain systemic agents, depending on the agent and the RT site, to manage symptoms or achieve local control.
*   **Concurrent vs Sequential Chemo-RT decision:** For palliative RT, concurrent chemo-RT is less common unless there's a specific radiosensitizing chemotherapy that also controls systemic disease. Most palliative RT is given sequentially to minimize toxicity.
*   **Treatment Breaks Considerations:** Unplanned breaks should be minimized as they can reduce treatment efficacy, especially for curative-intent treatments. For palliative treatments, breaks might be necessary to manage acute toxicities but should be discussed carefully.

### 7. Guideline Citations

*   **NCCN Guidelines for Ovarian Cancer (e.g., V.3.2024):** These guidelines clearly state that radiation therapy has a limited role in the primary management of advanced ovarian cancer. The primary treatment modalities are surgery and chemotherapy, with targeted therapies like PARP inhibitors (e.g., Olaparib for BRCA1/HRD positive patients) and anti-angiogenic agents (Bevacizumab) playing a crucial role in maintenance.
*   **ASTRO/ESTRO Guidelines for Palliative Radiotherapy:** Guidelines such as those for bone metastases (e.g., ASTRO's practice parameter for the palliative treatment of bone metastases) or brain metastases (e.g., ASTRO/ESTRO consensus guidelines for SRS) provide evidence-based recommendations for dose, fractionation, and technique when RT is indicated for symptom control.
*   **Evidence Level and Key Trials:** The lack of a primary role for RT in advanced ovarian cancer is supported by decades of clinical experience and trials demonstrating the superiority of systemic approaches for diffuse peritoneal disease. Modern trials focus on surgical optimization, novel chemotherapy agents, and targeted therapies.

### 8. Indian Healthcare Context

*   **LINAC Availability Considerations:** In major metropolitan cities like Hyderabad (KL), there is excellent availability of modern Linear Accelerators (LINACs). Most large private hospitals and some government institutions are equipped with state-of-the-art machines. However, in smaller towns and rural areas, access can be limited.
*   **Technique Availability (IMRT vs 3D-CRT):** IMRT and VMAT are widely available in private healthcare facilities in metros. 3D-CRT is a standard technique available in almost all centers equipped with a LINAC, including public sector hospitals. For Ms. Menon, given her private insurance and location in KL, access to IMRT/VMAT would not be an issue if palliative RT were needed.
*   **Wait Times at Different Centers:** Private centers typically have minimal wait times (a few days to a week) for starting radiation therapy. Public sector hospitals, however, can have significant wait times, ranging from several weeks to months, due to high patient volumes and limited

## Palliative Care Assessment for Anita Menon, 55F, Stage IIIC HGSOC

**Patient:** Anita Menon, 55F
**Diagnosis:** Stage IIIC (T3cN1M0) High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma (HGSOC), BRCA1 germline mutation, HRD positive.
**Clinical Question:** Optimal surgical approach (PDS vs NACT-IDS)? Role of HIPEC? Maintenance therapy selection - bevacizumab vs olaparib vs combination? Family screening recommendations?

As a Palliative Care specialist, my assessment focuses on optimizing Anita's quality of life, managing symptoms, supporting her and her family through her illness trajectory, and ensuring her values and preferences guide her care decisions. Early integration of palliative care has been shown to improve patient outcomes, including quality of life and potentially survival, in advanced cancers.

### 1. Performance Status Assessment

*   **Detailed interpretation of ECOG and functional status:** Anita's ECOG Performance Status of 1 indicates she is fully ambulatory and able to carry out light work or sedentary activities, though she may experience some restriction in physically strenuous activity. This is an excellent baseline for a patient with Stage IIIC HGSOC. At this stage, it's crucial to further assess her Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) such as dressing, bathing, eating, and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs) like managing finances, shopping, and housework. Given her ECOG 1, we anticipate she is independent in most, if not all, of these. However, early disease symptoms like abdominal bloating or fatigue, even if mild, might subtly impact her IADLs.
*   **Trajectory assessment:** For Stage IIIC HGSOC, the disease trajectory is typically characterized by periods of remission and recurrence. While initial aggressive treatment aims for optimal debulking and prolonged disease-free intervals, the chronic nature of the disease necessitates ongoing supportive care. We must prepare Anita and her family for potential fluctuations in her physical and emotional well-being throughout her treatment journey.
*   **Fitness for proposed treatments:** An ECOG 1 makes Anita an excellent candidate for aggressive treatment approaches, including Primary Debulking Surgery (PDS) or Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy followed by Interval Debulking Surgery (NACT-IDS). Her robust performance status also supports the consideration of HIPEC if deemed oncologically beneficial and she maintains this status post-NACT. Similarly, she is fit for systemic chemotherapy and subsequent maintenance therapies (Olaparib, Bevacizumab, or combination), which can have cumulative toxicities that are better tolerated by individuals with good baseline performance. Regular reassessment of her ECOG status and functional abilities throughout treatment is vital, as this can change rapidly due to disease progression or treatment-related side effects.

### 2. Symptom Assessment & Management

Based on her diagnosis and proposed treatments, Anita is likely to experience several symptoms. Proactive management is key.

*   **Anticipated symptoms:**
    *   **Disease-related:** Abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, early satiety, nausea, fatigue, bowel habit changes (constipation/diarrhea), ascites.
    *   **Treatment-related (Chemotherapy):** Nausea/vomiting, fatigue, myelosuppression (risk of infection), peripheral neuropathy, hair loss, mucositis, constipation.
    *   **Treatment-related (Surgery):** Post-operative pain, fatigue, wound complications, bowel dysfunction (ileus, adhesions).
    *   **Treatment-related (PARP Inhibitors e.g., Olaparib):** Nausea, fatigue, anemia, myelosuppression.
    *   **Treatment-related (Bevacizumab):** Hypertension, proteinuria, wound healing complications, gastrointestinal perforation risk.
*   **Specific management recommendations:**
    *   **Pain:** Start with paracetamol (500-1000mg every 6-8h PRN/scheduled). If persistent, add NSAIDs (e.g., Etoricoxib 60-90mg OD) with GI protection (PPI) or weak opioids (Tramadol 50-100mg QID PRN). For moderate-severe pain, escalate to strong opioids (e.g., Oral Morphine 5-10mg every 4h PRN, titrating as needed, or Fentanyl patch for stable pain). Neuropathic pain (e.g., from chemotherapy) may require Gabapentin (starting 300mg OD, titrating up to 900-1800mg/day) or Pregabalin (starting 75mg OD, titrating up to 150-300mg/day).
    *   **Nausea/Vomiting:** Prophylactic anti-emetics are crucial for chemotherapy. Standard regimen: 5-HT3 antagonist (Ondansetron 8mg BID/TID) + Dexamethasone (8-12mg OD-BID) + NK1 antagonist (Aprepitant/Fosaprepitant for highly emetogenic regimens). For breakthrough nausea, Metoclopramide (10mg TID PRN) or Prochlorperazine (5-10mg TID PRN).
    *   **Fatigue:** Non-pharmacological strategies: energy conservation, planned rest periods, light exercise (walking), good sleep hygiene. Rule out treatable causes like anemia, hypothyroidism, depression.
    *   **Bowel Dysfunction:** For constipation (common with opioids/chemo): Prophylactic laxatives (e.g., Lactulose 15-30ml OD/BID or Polyethylene Glycol sachets OD/BID) and stool softeners (Docusate Sodium 100mg BID). For diarrhea (less common, but possible): Loperamide (4mg stat, then 2mg after each loose stool, max 16mg/day).
    *   **Ascites:** Diuretics (e.g., Furosemide 20-40mg OD + Spironolactone 100mg OD) may offer temporary relief. Therapeutic paracentesis for symptomatic relief of abdominal distension and dyspnea.
    *   **Peripheral Neuropathy:** Vitamin B complex supplementation. Gabapentin/Pregabalin for symptomatic relief. Physical therapy.

### 3. Quality of Life Considerations

*   **Impact of proposed treatments on QoL:** All proposed treatments, while potentially life-prolonging, carry significant QoL burdens.
    *   **Surgery (PDS/IDS/HIPEC):** Major surgery involves prolonged recovery, potential for stomas, pain, fatigue, and body image concerns.
    *   **Chemotherapy:** Cyclical fatigue, nausea, hair loss, myelosuppression, and risk of neuropathy significantly impact daily life.
    *   **Maintenance Therapy (Olaparib/Bevacizumab):** While generally better tolerated than active chemotherapy, these are long-term treatments. Olaparib can cause chronic fatigue, nausea, and myelosuppression. Bevacizumab requires regular monitoring for hypertension and proteinuria and carries a small risk of serious complications.
*   **Trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity:** This is a critical discussion point. We need to help Anita understand the potential survival benefits of each treatment arm against the anticipated side effects and their duration. For example, the decision between PDS and NACT-IDS might involve weighing the immediate surgical burden against potential improved resectability and reduced toxicity with NACT. Similarly, the choice of maintenance therapy (Olaparib for BRCA1/HRD+ vs. Bevacizumab for angiogenesis inhibition vs. combination) will involve a detailed discussion of their respective toxicity profiles and efficacy benefits.
*   **Patient preferences exploration:** Anita's definition of "good quality of life" is paramount. Does she prioritize maximal survival at any cost, or is she willing to trade some survival benefit for less aggressive treatment and better daily functioning? What activities are most important to her? Her ability to travel, spend time with family, or pursue hobbies should be considered. These discussions should be ongoing, as her priorities may shift over time.

### 4. Goals of Care Discussion

*   **Recommended approach to goals conversation:** This should be an early, iterative, and open conversation, involving Anita and her identified family members. I recommend using a structured approach like the SPIKES protocol for delivering bad news and discussing sensitive topics. Start by assessing her understanding of her diagnosis and prognosis ("What is your understanding of your illness?"). Then, explore her informational preferences ("How much information would you like to know?").
*   **Treatment intent clarification:** For Stage IIIC HGSOC, the treatment intent is typically *life-prolonging* and aimed at achieving long-term remission, rather than a definitive cure. This distinction is important. While aggressive treatment can lead to prolonged survival, it is crucial to set realistic expectations and ensure Anita understands that the goal is to control the disease, manage symptoms, and maintain her quality of life for as long as possible.
*   **Advance Care Planning (ACP) recommendations:** Given the chronic nature of her illness, ACP is essential. This involves discussing her wishes for future medical care, identifying a surrogate decision-maker (e.g., husband, child) who can speak for her if she loses capacity, and documenting these preferences. While formal "living wills" are not universally recognized in India, a documented statement of wishes, ideally witnessed, can guide her family and medical team. Discussions should cover preferences regarding resuscitation, intensive care, and feeding tubes, especially as the disease progresses.

### 5. Psychosocial Support

*   **Patient emotional support needs:** Anita is likely to experience anxiety, fear of recurrence, depression, and body image concerns. Regular screening for distress using tools like the NCCN Distress Thermometer is recommended. Referral to an oncology psychologist or counselor is crucial. Peer support groups can also be invaluable.
*   **Family/caregiver support:** The family, especially the primary caregiver, will experience significant emotional, physical, and financial burden. We must identify the primary caregiver(s), assess their support needs, provide education on symptom management, and offer respite care options where available. Family meetings are important to address concerns, facilitate communication, and ensure alignment of goals.
*   **Spiritual care considerations:** In the Indian context, spirituality and faith often play a significant role in coping with illness. We should explore Anita's spiritual beliefs and connect her with spiritual leaders or practices if desired. This can provide comfort, meaning, and a sense of hope.

### 6. Nutritional Support

*   **Nutritional assessment:** Patients with advanced ovarian cancer are at high risk of malnutrition due to disease-related symptoms (early satiety, nausea, ascites, bowel obstruction) and treatment side effects. A comprehensive nutritional assessment, including weight history, dietary intake, and biochemical markers, is essential at baseline and throughout treatment.
*   **Dietary recommendations:** Small, frequent, high-calorie, high-protein meals are recommended. Soft, bland foods may be better tolerated during chemotherapy. Avoiding gas-forming foods can help with bloating.
*   **Supplementation if needed:** Oral nutritional supplements (e.g., high-protein drinks) should be offered if oral intake is insufficient. Supplementation with essential vitamins (e.g., Vitamin D, B12) and minerals (e.g., Iron) should be guided by deficiencies. In

**Dr. Chitran's Radiology Assessment for Anita Menon**

**Patient:** Anita Menon, 55yo Female
**Diagnosis:** Stage IIIC (T3cN1M0) High Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma (HGSOC)
**Date of Assessment:** [Current Date]

As the Onco-Radiology specialist for this multidisciplinary tumor board, I have thoroughly reviewed the provided patient summary and will outline a comprehensive radiological assessment. Given the advanced stage and genomic profile, precise imaging is paramount for guiding treatment decisions.

---

### 1. STAGING COMPLETENESS ASSESSMENT

Based on the Stage IIIC (T3cN1M0) diagnosis, it is highly probable that a **Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis (CAP)** has been performed. This is the cornerstone for initial staging of ovarian cancer.

*   **Review of Imaging Performed (Inferred):**
    *   **CECT CAP:** Essential for evaluating the primary tumor, extent of peritoneal disease, nodal status, and distant metastases. This modality is generally excellent for assessing macroscopic disease.
*   **Gaps in Staging Workup:**
    *   While CECT CAP provides a good overview, its sensitivity for detecting small peritoneal implants (<5mm) and differentiating benign from malignant lymph nodes can be limited. The extent of small bowel involvement, crucial for surgical planning, might also be underestimated.
    *   Specifically, a dedicated pelvic MRI might offer superior soft-tissue contrast for local tumor invasion and small peritoneal implants within the pelvis.
*   **Additional Imaging Recommended:**
    *   **Dedicated Pelvic MRI with Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI):** Recommended for a more precise assessment of local tumor extent, invasion into adjacent organs (bladder, bowel serosa, uterus), and detection of small peritoneal implants within the pelvis. DWI can improve lesion detection and characterization.
    *   **Whole-Body PET-CT (with FDG):** Given the high CA-125 (1,250 U/mL) and Stage IIIC disease, a PET-CT would be highly beneficial. It offers superior sensitivity for detecting occult peritoneal disease, small nodal metastases, and unsuspected distant metastases (e.g., small lung nodules, bone lesions) that might be missed by conventional CT. This is particularly relevant for confirming M0 status and assessing the full extent of disease burden for surgical planning.

### 2. PRIMARY TUMOR CHARACTERIZATION (Inferred from T3c)

*   **Size, Location, Morphology:** The primary tumor involves **bilateral ovaries**. As HGSOC, imaging would typically show large, complex adnexal masses, often with solid components, irregular margins, thick septations, and papillary projections. The T3c stage implies significant tumor burden, likely with macroscopic peritoneal involvement.
*   **Local Invasion Assessment:** T3c indicates macroscopic peritoneal metastases beyond the pelvis and/or retroperitoneal lymph nodes >2cm. Imaging should have demonstrated:
    *   **Omental cake:** Thickening and nodularity of the omentum.
    *   **Ascites:** Presence of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity.
    *   **Peritoneal implants:** Nodules on the parietal and visceral peritoneum, diaphragm, bowel serosa, and mesentery.
    *   **Liver/Spleen Capsular Invasion:** Nodularity or enhancement on the surface of the liver or spleen.
    *   **Bowel Involvement:** Serosal implants on the small or large bowel, potentially leading to bowel wall thickening or obstruction.
*   **Resectability from Imaging Perspective:** The presence of T3c disease, especially with extensive peritoneal carcinomatosis (e.g., high Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Index - PCI), can pose challenges for optimal cytoreduction. Imaging must meticulously map the extent of disease, particularly areas that are difficult to resect without significant morbidity, such as:
    *   Extensive disease on the small bowel mesentery or serosa.
    *   Bulky disease in the porta hepatis or around major vessels.
    *   Extensive diaphragmatic involvement.
    *   These findings will critically inform the decision between Primary Debulking Surgery (PDS) and Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy followed by Interval Debulking Surgery (NACT-IDS).

### 3. NODAL ASSESSMENT (Inferred from N1)

*   **Regional Nodes Involved:** N1 status indicates regional lymph node metastasis. For ovarian cancer, this typically includes pelvic (external iliac, internal iliac, obturator) and para-aortic/paracaval lymph nodes.
*   **Size Criteria and Morphology:**
    *   **Pelvic/Inguinal Nodes:** Short axis diameter >1.0 cm is considered suspicious.
    *   **Retroperitoneal Nodes (Para-aortic/Paracaval):** Short axis diameter >1.0 cm is also suspicious, though some guidelines use >1.5 cm.
    *   **Morphology:** Pathologic nodes often appear rounder, have heterogeneous enhancement, lose their fatty hilum, and may show central necrosis or calcification.
*   **Pathologic vs. Reactive Differentiation:** Imaging, even with PET-CT, cannot definitively differentiate pathologic from reactive nodes without histological confirmation. However, increased FDG avidity on PET-CT strongly suggests malignancy in morphologically abnormal nodes.

### 4. METASTATIC WORKUP (Inferred from M0)

*   **Sites Evaluated:** CECT CAP evaluates the lungs, liver parenchyma, spleen parenchyma, adrenal glands, kidneys, and limited skeletal structures (bones within the scan field).
*   **Distant Metastases Present/Absent:** M0 status implies the absence of distant metastases, such as:
    *   Parenchymal liver or spleen metastases.
    *   Lung parenchymal metastases (e.g., nodules >5mm, or multiple smaller nodules).
    *   Pleural effusion with positive cytology (though effusions themselves are often T4).
    *   Brain or bone metastases (unless specifically evaluated, usually not part of routine CAP CT unless symptomatic).
*   **Indeterminate Findings Requiring Follow-up:** Small, sub-centimeter lung nodules, hepatic cysts or hemangiomas, or small adrenal adenomas are common indeterminate findings that may require short-term follow-up imaging (e.g., 3-6 months) or further characterization (e.g., MRI for liver lesions, dedicated adrenal protocol CT).

### 5. STAGING CONFIRMATION

*   **Confirm/Refine Clinical Stage based on Imaging:** Based on the inferred imaging findings for T3cN1M0, the Stage IIIC classification is consistent. The detailed imaging should confirm the extent of peritoneal involvement and nodal disease.
*   **TNM Breakdown with Imaging Rationale (AJCC 8th Edition):**
    *   **T3c:** Macroscopic peritoneal metastasis outside the pelvis (e.g., omental caking, implants on diaphragm, bowel serosa, mesentery) AND/OR retroperitoneal lymph nodes >2cm. Imaging should clearly delineate these areas.
    *   **N1:** Regional lymph node metastasis (pelvic and/or para-aortic nodes meeting size and/or morphological criteria, or showing FDG avidity on PET-CT).
    *   **M0:** No distant metastasis, specifically no parenchymal metastases in the liver, spleen, lungs, or other distant sites. This needs careful confirmation on all imaging modalities.
*   **AJCC Edition Used:** **AJCC 8th Edition** is the current standard for staging ovarian cancer.

### 6. IMAGING FOR TREATMENT PLANNING

*   **RT Simulation Imaging Needs:** While primary ovarian cancer rarely requires upfront external beam radiotherapy, it might be considered for palliative intent or for specific sites of residual disease after surgery/chemotherapy. If so, a dedicated **CT simulation with appropriate immobilization** (e.g., vacuum cushion) would be required. Intravenous and/or oral contrast may be used to delineate target volumes and organs at risk.
*   **Surgical Planning Imaging:** The current CECT CAP, supplemented by the recommended Pelvic MRI and PET-CT,

## Pathology Assessment: Anita Menon, 55yo Female, Stage IIIC HGSOC

**Pathologist**: Dr. Marga
**Date**: October 26, 2023

This comprehensive pathology assessment reviews the submitted information for Ms. Anita Menon, a 55-year-old female diagnosed with Stage IIIC High Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma (HGSOC), focusing on diagnostic confirmation, biomarker status, molecular profiling, prognostic and predictive markers, and recommendations within the Indian healthcare context.

---

### 1. Diagnosis Confirmation

The diagnosis of High-Grade Serous Carcinoma (HGSOC) of bilateral ovaries is consistent with the clinical presentation and reported histology.

*   **Histopathologic Diagnosis Review**: HGSOC is the most common and aggressive type of epithelial ovarian cancer, characterized by high nuclear grade, significant pleomorphism, atypical mitotic figures, and often widespread serous differentiation. While specific microscopic details are not provided in the summary, the diagnosis is presumptively confirmed by a qualified pathologist based on these characteristic features, likely including immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for markers such as WT1, p53 (aberrant staining pattern), and PAX8, which are typically positive in HGSOC.
*   **WHO Classification**: This diagnosis aligns with the 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Female Genital Tumours (5th Edition), which recognizes HGSOC as a distinct entity with specific morphological and molecular characteristics.
*   **Histologic Grade and its Significance**: HGSOC is, by definition, a high-grade tumor. This inherent high grade signifies an aggressive tumor biology with a propensity for rapid growth and metastatic spread, even at early stages. The clinical stage of IIIC (T3cN1M0) further underscores the advanced nature of the disease, involving regional lymph nodes and/or peritoneal dissemination beyond the pelvis.

---

### 2. Biomarker Status Review

Several key biomarkers have been assessed, providing critical information for prognosis and treatment selection.

*   **CA-125**: The elevated level of 1,250 U/mL is highly characteristic of advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma, particularly HGSOC. CA-125 is a glycoprotein commonly used for diagnosis, monitoring treatment response, and surveillance for recurrence. Its high baseline level is indicative of significant tumor burden.
*   **HE4**: An elevated HE4 level, in conjunction with CA-125, is often used in algorithms like ROMA (Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm) for differentiating benign from malignant pelvic masses. While less specific for HGSOC than CA-125 for diagnosis, its elevation further supports the malignant nature and can be used for monitoring, similar to CA-125.
*   **HRD Score**: A positive HRD (Homologous Recombination Deficiency) score of 52 is a highly significant finding. HRD indicates a defect in the cell's ability to repair double-strand DNA breaks via homologous recombination, leading to genomic instability. This score is above the typical threshold for HRD positivity (often >42).
*   **Methodology Used**:
    *   CA-125 and HE4 are typically assessed via immunoassay (e.g., ELISA or chemiluminescence immunoassay) on serum samples.
    *   HRD scoring is usually performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based genomic scar analysis, which evaluates specific patterns of genomic alterations (e.g., loss of heterozygosity, telomeric allelic imbalance, large-scale state transitions). Examples include Myriad MyChoice CDx or FoundationOne CDx.
*   **Quality Assessment of Testing**: Assuming these tests were performed in NABL/CAP-accredited laboratories, the results can be considered reliable. For HRD and genomic profiling, the use of validated assays with appropriate controls is paramount.

---

### 3. Molecular Profile Analysis

The molecular profile provides crucial insights into the tumor's biology and therapeutic vulnerabilities.

*   **BRCA1 Germline 185delAG (ACTIONABLE)**: The identification of a germline *BRCA1* pathogenic variant (185delAG) is a cornerstone finding. This mutation is well-established as a driver of HGSOC, conferring increased lifetime risk. It is a direct cause of homologous recombination deficiency, explaining the positive HRD score. This mutation is highly actionable, predicting exquisite sensitivity to PARP inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy. As it is a germline mutation, it has implications for family screening. Methodology: Typically performed via germline sequencing (blood sample).
*   **TP53 R248Q**: A *TP53* mutation is present, specifically R248Q, a common hotspot mutation. *TP53* mutations are identified in over 90% of HGSOC cases and are considered a hallmark of the disease. This mutation typically leads to a loss of function of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. While generally associated with more aggressive tumor behavior, the presence of a *TP53* mutation does not negate the benefits of platinum-based chemotherapy or PARP inhibitors in the setting of *BRCA* mutation/HRD. Methodology: Somatic NGS on tumor tissue.
*   **TMB (Tumor Mutational Burden)**: A TMB of 3 mut/Mb is considered low. HGSOC typically has a low TMB. Low TMB generally suggests a limited likelihood of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) as monotherapy. Methodology: NGS on tumor tissue.
*   **MSI (Microsatellite Instability)**: The tumor is Microsatellite Stable (MSS). This finding is consistent with the low TMB and the typical molecular profile of HGSOC. MSS tumors, similar to those with low TMB, are generally less likely to respond to ICI monotherapy. Methodology: PCR or NGS on tumor tissue.
*   **Variants of Unknown Significance (VUS)**: No VUS were reported. However, in comprehensive genomic profiling, VUS can be encountered and require careful interpretation in the context of clinical guidelines and functional studies.

---

### 4. Additional Testing Recommendations

Given the comprehensive molecular profiling already performed, further immediate biomarker testing on the primary tumor tissue is not critically indicated for initial treatment planning.

*   **Missing Biomarkers**: PD-L1 IHC testing is generally not routinely recommended for ovarian HGSOC, especially in the context of low TMB and MSS, as the likelihood of response to single-agent immunotherapy is low.
*   **Reflex Testing Needs**: No immediate reflex testing is required based on the current results.
*   **Tissue Adequacy for Additional Testing**: It is essential to confirm the availability of sufficient residual tissue from the primary tumor block for any future testing, such as re-biopsy at recurrence, which may be needed to identify acquired resistance mechanisms.

---

### 5. Prognostic Features

Several factors contribute to Ms. Menon's prognosis.

*   **Histologic Features Affecting Prognosis**: HGSOC itself is the most important histologic prognostic factor, indicating an aggressive disease course.
*   **Grade**: As HGSOC, the tumor is intrinsically high-grade, signifying aggressive behavior.
*   **LVI (Lymphovascular Invasion)**: The presence or absence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was not reported. If available, assessment for LVI is recommended as it indicates a higher risk of lymphatic and hematogenous metastasis and poorer prognosis.
*   **PNI (Perineural Invasion)**: Perineural invasion (PNI) is less common in ovarian HGSOC but, if present, can indicate a more locally aggressive disease and potentially poorer outcomes. This should be assessed if not already done.
*   **Other Prognostic Markers**: Stage IIIC (T3cN1M0) is an advanced stage, inherently carrying a less favorable prognosis than earlier stages. The extent of residual disease after primary debulking surgery (PDS) is the most critical surgical prognostic factor. While *BRCA* mutations are predictive of PARP inhibitor response, some studies suggest that *BRCA*-mutated HGSOC may have a slightly better prognosis with standard platinum-based chemotherapy compared to *BRCA*-wildtype HGSOC.

---

### 6. Predictive Markers

Ms. Menon's molecular profile includes highly predictive markers that will guide targeted therapy.

*   **Markers Predicting Treatment Response**:
    *   **BRCA1 Germline Mutation & HRD Positive**: These are strong predictive markers for exceptional sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy and, more importantly, to PARP inhibitors (e.g., olaparib). The presence of both a *BRCA1* mutation and a positive HRD score unequivocally establishes a "BRCA-like" phenotype, making her an ideal candidate for PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy.
    *   **TMB Low and MSI-MSS**: These indicate a very low probability of response to single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors.
*   **Companion Diagnostic Requirements**:
    *   The *BRCA1* germline mutation and HRD positivity serve as companion diagnostics for PARP inhibitor therapy (e.g., olaparib). Regulatory approvals for PARP inhibitors often require documentation of either a *BRCA* mutation or HRD positivity.
*   **Drug-Biomarker Associations**:
    *   **PARP Inhibitors (e.

## Genetics and Molecular Oncology Assessment: Anita Menon, 55yo Female, Stage IIIC HGSOC

**Patient:** Anita Menon, 55yo Female
**Diagnosis:** OVARIAN - High Grade Serous Carcinoma (HGSOC), Stage IIIC (T3cN1M0)
**Key Findings:** BRCA1 Germline 185delAG, HRD Positive (score 52), TP53 R248Q

---

As Dr. Anuvamsha, I have reviewed the comprehensive genomic and biomarker profile for Ms. Anita Menon. The findings are highly significant and provide clear guidance for therapeutic management and family risk assessment. My detailed assessment is as follows:

### 1. Somatic Mutation Analysis

While the report lists "BRCA1 Germline 185delAG" under "Genomic Profile," it is crucial to clarify that this is a **germline (inherited) mutation**, not a somatic (tumor-acquired) one. Its presence in the tumor indicates it was present in all cells of the patient's body from birth.

*   **BRCA1 Germline 185delAG (c.68_69delAG):**
    *   **Interpretation & Pathogenicity:** This is a well-established pathogenic frameshift deletion mutation in the *BRCA1* gene. It results in a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated, non-functional BRCA1 protein. According to ACMG/AMP guidelines, this variant is classified as **Pathogenic (Class 5)**. It is a known founder mutation, particularly prevalent in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, but can be found in other populations as well.
    *   **Allele Frequency Significance:** As a germline mutation, it is present in a heterozygous state (one copy of the gene is mutated, the other is wild-type) in all somatic cells. In the tumor, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the *BRCA1* locus is common, meaning the wild-type allele is lost, leaving only the mutated allele, which contributes to tumor development. This LOH is a key driver of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD).

*   **TP53 R248Q (c.743G>A):**
    *   **Interpretation & Pathogenicity:** This is a missense mutation in the *TP53* gene, resulting in an arginine to glutamine substitution at codon 248. R248 is a well-known "hotspot" residue within the DNA-binding domain of TP53, critical for its tumor suppressor function. Mutations at this site frequently lead to loss of TP53’s ability to bind DNA and regulate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This variant is classified as **Pathogenic (Class 5)** by ACMG/AMP criteria, and is widely reported in databases like ClinVar and the IARC TP53 Database as deleterious.
    *   **Allele Frequency Significance:** The allele frequency in the tumor is not provided, but *TP53* mutations are nearly ubiquitous (96-98%) in HGSOC, often occurring early in tumor development. While not directly actionable with targeted therapies, it signifies aggressive disease biology and often correlates with genomic instability.

*   **TMB: 3 mut/Mb:**
    *   **Interpretation:** This indicates a low Tumor Mutational Burden. HGSOC typically has a low TMB, making it less likely to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors based solely on TMB.

*   **MSI: MSS (Microsatellite Stable):**
    *   **Interpretation:** Microsatellite stability is expected in HGSOC. This finding confirms that the patient's tumor is unlikely to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting MSI-High status.

### 2. Therapeutic Implications

The presence of a **BRCA1 germline pathogenic mutation** and a **positive HRD score (52)** are highly actionable and constitute predictive biomarkers for response to platinum-based chemotherapy and, more importantly, to **PARP inhibitors**.

*   **Actionable Mutations and Corresponding Therapies:**
    *   **BRCA1 Germline Mutation & HRD Positive:** These findings strongly predict sensitivity to **PARP inhibitors** (PARPi). PARPi exploit the concept of synthetic lethality in cells with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), such as those with *BRCA1/2* mutations. They also enhance the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy.
    *   **FDA/DCGI Approved Indications & Level of Evidence:**
        *   **Olaparib (Lynparza®):**
            *   **Maintenance Therapy:** DCGI approved for maintenance treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed advanced HGSOC (Stage III-IV) who are in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and whose tumors have a deleterious or suspected deleterious *BRCA* mutation (germline or somatic), *or* are HRD-positive (defined by a positive myChoice® CDx test, which includes BRCAm and genomic instability score) in combination with bevacizumab.
            *   **Monotherapy Maintenance:** Also approved as maintenance for *BRCA*-mutated HGSOC after response to platinum-based chemotherapy.
            *   **Level of Evidence:** Category 1 (NCCN Guidelines), ESMO ESCAT I. Evidence from SOLO-1 (BRCAm maintenance), PAOLA-1 (HRD+ maintenance with bevacizumab).
        *   **Niraparib (Zejula®):**
            *   **Maintenance Therapy:** DCGI approved for maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced HGSOC who are in a complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, regardless of *BRCA* mutation status or HRD status (PRIMA trial). However, efficacy is highest in *BRCA*-mutated and HRD-positive patients.
            *   **Level of Evidence:** Category 1 (NCCN Guidelines), ESMO ESCAT I for BRCAm/HRD+.
        *   **Bevacizumab (Avastin® or biosimilars):**
            *   **Combination Therapy:** DCGI approved for first-line treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, followed by single-agent bevacizumab. In HRD-positive patients, it can be combined with olaparib as maintenance.
            *   **Level of Evidence:** Category 1 (NCCN Guidelines).
    *   **Platinum Sensitivity:** *BRCA1* mutations and HRD are highly predictive of response to platinum-based chemotherapy, suggesting that Ms. Menon will likely respond well to neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum regimens.

### 3. Resistance Considerations

While PARP inhibitors are highly effective, resistance can emerge over time.

*   **Known Resistance Mechanisms:**
    *   **Secondary Reversion Mutations:** Restoring the *BRCA* gene's open reading frame, leading to a functional BRCA protein and restored HR capacity.
    *   **Loss of PARP Trapping:** Reduced PARP1/2 trapping at DNA damage sites.
    *   **Upregulation of Efflux Pumps:** Such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), which pumps PARPi out of cells.
    *   **Restoration of HR Pathway:** Through other mechanisms, e.g., loss of 53BP1 or other non-BRCA HR pathway genes.
    *   **Alternative DNA Repair Pathways:** Activation of other repair pathways.
*   **Monitoring for Resistance:** Primarily clinical (symptom progression, imaging) and biochemical (rising CA-125). Routine molecular monitoring for resistance mutations is not standard practice but can be considered in a research setting or for re-biopsy upon progression.
*   **Sequencing of Targeted Agents:** For Ms. Menon, first-line treatment will involve platinum-based chemotherapy. The critical decision is maintenance therapy. Given her BRCA1 germline mutation and HRD positivity, a PARP inhibitor is strongly indicated.
    *   **Option 1:** Olaparib monotherapy maintenance (if achieved CR/PR to platinum).
    *   **Option 2:** Olaparib + Bevacizumab maintenance (if achieved CR/PR to platinum). This combination has shown superior PFS in HRD+ patients compared to bevacizumab alone (PAOLA-1 trial).
    *   **Option 3:** Niraparib monotherapy maintenance.
    The choice between these will depend on individual patient factors, toxicity profiles, and physician preference, but both Olaparib and Niraparib are excellent choices.

### 4. Clinical Trial Opportunities

Given Ms. Menon's specific molecular profile, she may be eligible for several clinical trials in India.

*   **Relevant Trials:** Trials investigating novel PARP inhibitors, combinations of PARP inhibitors with immunotherapy (though less likely to benefit given low TMB/MSS), ATR inhibitors, WEE1 inhibitors, or other DNA damage response (DDR) pathway inhibitors, especially in platinum-sensitive recurrent settings or as part of frontline intensification strategies.
*   **Basket/Umbrella Trial Eligibility:** Less likely for *TP53* given its prevalence and lack of direct targeting. However, basket trials for rare DDR pathway alterations could be relevant if other mutations are discovered.
*   **Trial Sites in India:** Major oncology centers in India frequently participate in international clinical trials for ovarian cancer. These include:
    *   Tata Memorial Hospital (Mumbai)
    *   All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) (Delhi)
    *   Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre (Delhi)
    *   Apollo Hospitals (various cities, including Chennai,

TUMOR BOARD CONSENSUS
================================================================================

# TUMOR BOARD CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION

**Patient:** Anita Menon, 55yo Female
**Diagnosis:** Stage IIIC (T3cN1M0) High Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma (HGSOC)
**Key Features:** BRCA1 Germline 185delAG, HRD Positive (score 52), ECOG 1, Controlled Hypothyroidism.

---

## 1. TREATMENT INTENT

The treatment intent for Ms. Anita Menon is **Life-prolonging with curative intent for achieving complete remission and long-term disease control**.

**Rationale:** While Stage IIIC HGSOC is an advanced disease with a high risk of recurrence, the presence of a BRCA1 germline mutation and HRD positivity indicates a tumor that is highly sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors. This biological profile offers an excellent opportunity for achieving a deep and durable response, potentially leading to a prolonged progression-free and overall survival. The goal is to maximize the chances of achieving no macroscopic residual disease (R0) after surgery and to consolidate this response with highly effective maintenance therapy. It is important to communicate to the patient that while complete remission is the immediate goal, the chronic nature of advanced ovarian cancer necessitates ongoing surveillance and management.

---

## 2. PRIMARY TREATMENT RECOMMENDATION

The primary treatment recommendation is a **Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT) followed by Interval Debulking Surgery (IDS), then completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, and finally, Olaparib monotherapy maintenance.**

**Specific Treatment Plan:**

1.  **Systemic Chemotherapy (NACT & Adjuvant):**
    *   **Regimen:** Carboplatin AUC 5-6 + Paclitaxel 175 mg/m$^2$ IV every 3 weeks.
    *   **Duration:** Total of 6 cycles.
    *   **Sequencing:** 3 cycles as NACT, followed by IDS, then the remaining 3 cycles as adjuvant chemotherapy.
    *   **Rationale:** This platinum-taxane doublet is the standard of care for first-line treatment of advanced HGSOC. The BRCA1 germline mutation and HRD positivity strongly predict high chemosensitivity, making NACT an effective strategy to reduce tumor burden, shrink peritoneal implants, and increase the likelihood of achieving R0 resection at IDS, with potentially reduced surgical morbidity.

2.  **Surgical Intervention (Interval Debulking Surgery - IDS):**
    *   **Approach:** Open laparotomy.
    *   **Procedure:** Comprehensive cytoreduction with the goal of achieving **R0 resection (no macroscopic residual disease)**. This will include:
        *   Total Abdominal Hysterectomy (TAH)
        *   Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy (BSO)
        *   Infracolic Omentectomy (and supracolic if involved)
        *   Complete peritoneal debulking, including stripping of the diaphragm, excision of any residual peritoneal implants from bowel serosa, mesentery, paracolic gutters, and pelvic sidewalls.
        *   Resection of any involved bowel segments or other organs if residual disease persists after NACT.
        *   Pelvic and Para-aortic Lymphadenectomy to address N1 disease and complete staging.
    *   **Rationale:** Given the Stage IIIC (T3cN1M0) disease and high CA-125, upfront Primary Debulking Surgery (PDS) carries a high risk of suboptimal debulking (R1/R2) or significant surgical morbidity due to extensive multi-visceral resections. NACT is expected to downstage the disease, making IDS more feasible for achieving R0, which is the strongest prognostic factor for survival.

3.  **Maintenance Therapy:**
    *   **Agent:** Olaparib (Lynparza®)
    *   **Dose:** 300 mg orally twice daily (BID).
    *   **Duration:** 2 years.
    *   **Rationale:** The BRCA1 germline mutation and HRD positivity make Ms. Menon an ideal candidate for PARP inhibitor maintenance. The SOLO-1 trial demonstrated a profound and sustained improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with olaparib monotherapy in newly diagnosed, advanced HGSOC patients with *BRCA1/2* mutations who responded to platinum-based chemotherapy. This approach significantly extends the period of disease control and is considered the standard of care in this specific patient population.

4.  **Role of HIPEC & Radiation Therapy:**
    *   **HIPEC:** Not recommended in the primary setting due to lack of robust evidence for routine use outside of clinical trials and potential added morbidity.
    *   **Radiation Therapy:** No role in the primary or adjuvant management of diffuse Stage IIIC ovarian cancer. Its use is limited to palliative intent for localized symptomatic recurrences in the future, if needed.

---

## 3. TREATMENT SEQUENCE (Step-by-Step)

**Phase 1: Pre-NACT Workup & Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (Approx. 3 months)**
*   **Initial Workup (1-2 weeks):**
    *   **Radiology:** Complete CECT Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis (if not recent), Pelvic MRI with DWI, and **Whole-Body PET-CT** (to accurately assess full disease burden and confirm M0 status).
    *   **Medical Clearance:** Comprehensive cardiac evaluation (ECG, echo), repeat TFTs (ensure euthyroid), full blood work (CBC, LFT, RFT, electrolytes, viral markers).
    *   **Palliative Care:** Initial consultation for comprehensive symptom assessment, goals of care discussion, and advance care planning.
    *   **Genetic Counseling:** Formal session for Ms. Menon and discussion regarding family screening.
    *   **Nutritional Assessment:** To optimize nutritional status before chemotherapy.
*   **NACT Initiation (Weeks 1-9):**
    *   **Cycles 1-3 of Carboplatin/Paclitaxel.** Administer every 3 weeks.
    *   **Monitoring:** Weekly CBC, LFT/RFT before each cycle, neurologic assessment. Symptom management by medical oncology and palliative care.

**Phase 2: Re-evaluation & Interval Debulking Surgery (IDS) (Approx. 1-2 months)**
*   **Re-evaluation (Week 10-12, after 3 NACT cycles):**
    *   **Clinical Assessment:** Performance status, symptom resolution.
    *   **Tumor Markers:** Repeat CA-125 and HE4. A significant drop (>50%) indicates good response.
    *   **Imaging:** Repeat CECT Abdomen & Pelvis (and chest if indicated) to assess tumor response and re-evaluate resectability. A PET-CT can be considered if there are equivocal findings or to confirm metabolic response.
    *   **Decision Point:** If there is a good response to NACT and the disease is deemed resectable to R0, proceed to IDS. If there is poor response or progression, re-evaluate treatment strategy (e.g., consider alternative chemotherapy regimen, or if progression, discuss palliative options).
*   **Interval Debulking Surgery (IDS) (Week 12-14):**
    *   Performed by an experienced gynecologic surgical oncologist.
    *   **Post-op Recovery:** Monitor for complications, pain management, early mobilization. Palliative care support for post-operative symptoms.

**Phase 3: Adjuvant Chemotherapy & Maintenance Therapy (Approx. 27 months)**
*   **Adjuvant Chemotherapy (Weeks 15-23):**
    *   **Cycles 4-6 of Carboplatin/Paclitaxel.** Initiate once Ms. Menon has recovered from surgery (typically 4-6 weeks post-op) and her blood counts have normalized.
    *   **Monitoring:** As per NACT.
*   **Maintenance Therapy (Weeks 24 onwards, for 2 years):**
    *   **Initiation:** Start Olaparib 300 mg BID within 8 weeks of completing the final chemotherapy cycle, assuming recovery from acute toxicities and acceptable blood counts.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monthly CBC for the first year, then periodically. Monitor for nausea, fatigue, anemia.
    *   **Decision Point:** Continue Olaparib for 2 years unless there is disease progression or intolerable toxicity.

## 4. KEY SPECIALIST AGREEMENTS

*   **Surgical Approach:** Consensus on **Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT) followed by Interval Debulking Surgery (IDS)** as the optimal primary surgical strategy, given the Stage IIIC disease, high CA-125, and anticipated extent of disease. This approach aims to maximize the chances of achieving R0 resection (Dr. Shalya, Dr. Chikitsa, Dr. Chitran).
*   **Systemic Therapy:** Agreement on **Carboplatin and Paclitaxel** as the first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen (Dr. Chikitsa).
*   **Maintenance Therapy:** Strong consensus on **Olaparib monotherapy maintenance for 2 years** due to the confirmed BRCA1 germline mutation and HRD positivity, leveraging the robust data from the SOLO-1 trial (Dr. Chikitsa, Dr. Anuvamsha).
*   **Role of HIPEC & Radiation:** Unanimous agreement that **HIPEC and primary Radiation Therapy are not indicated** in this setting (Dr. Shalya, Dr. Chikitsa, Dr. Kirann).
*   **Genetic Counseling:** Emphasized as crucial for Ms. Menon and her family due to the germline BRCA1 mutation (Dr. Chikitsa, Dr. Anuvamsha).
*   **Palliative Care Integration:** Early and ongoing involvement of Palliative Care for symptom management, quality of life optimization, and goals of care discussions is strongly recommended throughout the treatment trajectory (Dr. Shanti).
*   **Comprehensive Staging Imaging:** The need for additional detailed imaging (Pelvic MRI, PET-CT) to fully delineate disease extent and guide treatment planning is highlighted (Dr. Chitran).
*   **Biomarker Significance:** All specialists acknowledge the critical role of BRCA1 germline mutation and HRD positivity in guiding treatment decisions and predicting response (Dr. Marga, Dr. Chikitsa, Dr. Anuvamsha).

## 5. ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS

1.  **Primary Debulking Surgery (PDS) first:** While NACT-IDS is preferred, if an experienced gynecologic surgical oncologist, after detailed pre-operative imaging (including PET-CT and Pelvic MRI) and possibly a diagnostic laparoscopy, confidently predicts R0 resection with acceptable morbidity, PDS could be considered. However, the T3c stage and high CA-125 suggest a high likelihood of extensive disease, making NACT-IDS generally safer and more effective for achieving R0.
2.  **Alternative PARP Inhibitors for Maintenance:** Niraparib monotherapy (Zejula®) for 2 years is another valid option for HRD-positive patients, supported by the PRIMA trial. While highly effective, Olaparib has the most extensive long-term data specifically in BRCA-mutated patients (SOLO-1).
3.  **Combination Maintenance (Olaparib + Bevacizumab):** The PAOLA-1 trial showed improved PFS with this combination in HRD-positive patients. While an option, for BRCA1-mutated patients, the incremental benefit of adding bevacizumab to olaparib is less pronounced than olaparib monotherapy, and it adds to toxicity (hypertension, proteinuria) and significantly increases cost. Therefore, Olaparib monotherapy is prioritized for Ms. Menon.
4.  **Bevacizumab Monotherapy Maintenance:** If PARP inhibitors are contraindicated or poorly tolerated, maintenance with Bevacizumab (Avastin® or biosimilars) for up to 12-15 months could be considered. This would be a less efficacious option than PARPi for a BRCA-mutated patient.
5.  **Cost-Constrained Alternatives:**
    *   **Chemotherapy only:** If Olaparib is financially unfeasible, Ms. Menon would complete 6 cycles of Carboplatin/Paclitaxel and then enter surveillance. This would significantly reduce costs but forgo the substantial PFS benefit of PARP inhibitor maintenance.
    *   **Bevacizumab Biosimilars:** If maintenance therapy is desired but Olaparib is too expensive, Bevacizumab biosimilars offer a maintenance option, albeit with different efficacy and toxicity profiles compared to PARPi.

## 6. PRE-TREATMENT REQUIREMENTS

Before initiating NACT, the following are mandatory:
*   **Radiology:**
    *   Review of recent CECT Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis.
    *   **Dedicated Pelvic MRI with Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI).**
    *   **Whole-Body PET-CT (FDG-PET/CT)** to confirm M0 status and assess the full extent of peritoneal disease.
*   **Laboratory:**
    *   Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential.
    *   Liver Function Tests (LFTs), Renal Function Tests (RFTs).
    *   Serum Electrolytes (Na, K, Ca, Mg).
    *   Thyroid Function Tests (TSH, Free T4) – ensure controlled hypothyroidism.
    *   Viral Markers (HBsAg, Anti-HCV, HIV).
    *   Baseline CA-125 and HE4.
*   **Medical Clearances:**
    *   **Cardiology Clearance** with ECG and Echocardiogram to assess cardiac fitness for chemotherapy and major surgery.
    *   **Anesthesia Fitness** for major abdominal surgery.
*   **Genetic Counseling:** Comprehensive session to discuss implications of BRCA1 germline mutation for Ms. Menon and her family, and to initiate family cascade testing.
*   **Palliative Care Consultation:** Initial detailed assessment, symptom review, and discussion of goals of care and advance care planning.
*   **Nutritional Assessment:** Formal assessment by a nutritionist to optimize dietary intake and consider supplements as needed.
*   **Dental Check-up:** To address any potential sources of infection before chemotherapy.

**Timeline:** This comprehensive workup should ideally be completed within **1-2 weeks** to allow for prompt initiation of NACT.

## 7. MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP PLAN

*   **During NACT:**
    *   **Clinical:** Weekly patient assessment for symptoms and performance status.
    *   **Laboratory:** Weekly CBC, LFT/RFT before each cycle.
    *   **Tumor Markers:** Repeat CA-125 after 3 cycles of NACT.
*   **After 3 Cycles NACT (Pre-IDS Re-evaluation):**
